# Squad Manager

A discord focused bot for Squad server management, built and designed for Sierra Zulu, released as open source.

This bot doesn't aim to replace Squad JS or other various integrations for managing Squad. Majority of the initial release will focus on management of the Server via Discord, but it's being built with a future UI being possible (or a 3rd party frontend if so desired). The initial tech stack will utilize Hono (as opposed to Express or Fastify) in order to provide an API focused layer, and the Discord and BM integrations will run beside this in the app. For a future UI, the eventual goal is to integrate Discord oauth, and possible other services if desired by others (though, again, this is a personal project, so PRs would be appreciated for that).

No license has been selected as of yet. It's likely that this will fall under a permissive license, likely MIT or Apache.
